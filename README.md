## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm 10.2.4+

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/clarkstontechnology/marketing.git

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server for all apps
npm run dev

# Or run a specific app
cd apps/clarkstontechnology
npm run dev
```

### Building for Production

```bash
# Build all apps
npm run build

# Build specific app
cd apps/clarkstontechnology
npm run build
```

## 📝 Development Workflow

### Development Server Management

#### Before Starting the Server
- **Check if already running**: The dev server might already be running on port 3000 or 3001
- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: Most code changes are applied automatically without needing to restart
- **When restart is needed**: Only for configuration changes, new dependencies, or environment variable updates

#### Managing Server Processes
```bash
# Check what's running on the default ports
lsof -i :3000 -i :3001

# Find all Node.js processes
ps aux | grep node

# Kill a specific process
kill -9 <PID>

# Kill all Node.js processes (use with caution)
killall node
```

### Documentation Structure

- **This README**: Monorepo-wide information, shared components, and general development guidelines
- **App-specific READMEs**: Located in each `apps/[app-name]/README.md` with site-specific details
- **Package READMEs**: (planned) Documentation for shared packages

### Adding a New Site

1. Create a new app in the `apps/` directory
2. Copy the structure from an existing app (e.g., clarkstontechnology)
3. Create a README.md in the new app directory
4. Update the site configuration in `src/config/site.ts`
5. Customize components and content as needed
6. Link the new README from this main README

### Adding Shared Components

1. Create component in `packages/ui/src/components/`
2. Export from `packages/ui/src/index.ts`
3. Import in any app using `import { ComponentName } from '@marketing/ui'`
4. Use variant-based components with CVA (class-variance-authority)
5. Keep components generic and reusable

### Best Practices

#### Component Development
- Shared UI components go in packages/ui
- Use variant-based components with CVA
- Keep components generic and reusable
- Check existing components before creating new ones

#### Styling
- Use Tailwind utility classes directly
- Avoid custom CSS variables in globals.css
- Shared Tailwind config in packages/config
- Use simple classes like `bg-blue-500` not `bg-background`

#### Testing
- E2E tests go in tests/e2e/
- Focus on functional testing (behavior over appearance)
- Use Playwright's built-in waiting mechanisms
- Test across multiple browsers and devices
- Different reporters: HTML for manual review, line reporter for CI/agents

### Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Run all apps in development mode
- `npm run build` - Build all apps for production
- `npm run lint` - Lint all code
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `npm run clean` - Clean all build artifacts
- `npm test` - Run E2E tests with HTML report
- `npm run test:agent` - Run E2E tests with line reporter (for CI/agents)
- `npm run test:ui` - Run tests in interactive UI mode

## 🔧 Configuration Notes

### Dependencies
- Use `"*"` instead of `"workspace:*"` for internal dependencies
- Tailwind plugins must be installed in the config package where tailwind.config.ts lives
- Always run `npm install` from the root directory

### Next.js App Setup
- Remove duplicate config files (keep .js not .ts/.mjs versions)
- Each app needs its own .eslintrc.js with `extends: ['next/core-web-vitals']`
- Use simple Tailwind classes, avoid CSS variables like `bg-background`
- Escape apostrophes in JSX with `&apos;`

### Temporary Files
- Use `tmp/` directory for temporary scripts and experiments
- This directory is gitignored and won't be committed
- Clean up tmp files when done

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

1. **npm workspace errors**: These appear in dev but don't break functionality - can be safely ignored
2. **Tailwind plugin errors**: Install @tailwindcss/forms, @tailwindcss/typography, etc. in packages/config
3. **ESLint import errors**: Add .eslintrc.js to each app with proper Next.js config
4. **Port conflicts**: Dev server automatically uses 3001 if 3000 is busy
5. **metadataBase warning**: This is informational only - add metadataBase in layout.tsx for production

## 🔍 Debugging Tips

1. If ESLint fails, check for app-specific .eslintrc.js
2. If Tailwind classes don't work, verify they're standard utilities
3. If build fails, check for unescaped apostrophes in JSX
4. If dependencies fail, try removing node_modules and reinstalling
5. Check logs after changes to catch new errors early
6. Build production bundles to catch compilation issues: `npm run build`
7. Playwright config uses port 3000 (Next.js default) - update if dev server runs on different port

- Mandates root cause analysis - no symptom fixes or workarounds

### Platform Updates
- Fixed Playwright test configuration to use correct port (3000)
- Updated testing documentation for clearer workflows

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

Each app should have its own `.env.local` file:

```env
# Site-specific
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://www.example.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME="Site Name"

# Shared services (when implemented)
DATABASE_URL=
RESEND_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=
```

### Deployment

The project is configured for deployment on Vercel:

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Configure each app as a separate project
3. Set the root directory to `apps/[app-name]`
4. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
